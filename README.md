iOS5Fonts
=========

One day we wanted to list off all of the fonts that a particular [iDevice][5] was capable of displaying. So I wrote
a quick and dirty app to display the fonts by [UIFont][2] family name on a [UIScrollView][1]. The [UILabel][3] displays
the font name and the text [The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog][4].
