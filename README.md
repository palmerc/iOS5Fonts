iOS5Fonts
=========

One day we wanted to list off all of the fonts that a particular iDevice was capable of displaying. So I wrote
a quick and dirty app to display the fonts by [UIFont][2] family name on a [UIScrollView.h][1]. The [UILabel][3] displays
the font name and the text The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Dog.
